Repository ---> Connects with database.
Services ---> All the logic.
Entity ---> To store data in the database.
DTO(Data Transfer Object) ---> Those objects that are need not to be stored in Database.
Controllers ---> All the function calling is done by the controllers.

JPA(Java Persistence API) ---> Provides pre-defined functions that helps in working with database and mapping.
ORM(Object Relational Mapping) ---> Helps in mapping object into relational database and vice versa. Hibernate handles
all of this in the backend in ORM. All we have to do is tell the mapping

JpaRepository<E, ID> ---> E means Entity and ID means what is the data type of primary key in the same entity.
